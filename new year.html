    <h1>Finishing Well and Stepping into the New Year with Faith</h1>
    <p><b>Scripture:</b> “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”
        <b>(Philippians 3:14)</b><br><br>

        <b>Introduction</b><br><br>
        As we gather on this final Sunday of the year, let us take a moment to reflect on the faithfulness of God
        throughout this past year. Regardless of the challenges or triumphs we faced, God has been with us. Today, I
        want to encourage us to finish this year well and step into the new one with renewed faith and purpose.
        <br><br>
    <h3>1. Reflect on God's Faithfulness (Psalm 103:1-5)</h3>
    <b>"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits..."</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Look back at the year with gratitude. Even in trials, God has sustained us.</li>

        <li>Acknowledge His faithfulness in the highs and lows. Gratitude sets the tone for entering the new year with
            hope.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Release the Past (Isaiah 43:18-19)</h3>
    <b>"Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing!"</b>

    <ul>
        <li>We cannot move forward if we are chained to past regrets, failures, or even successes.</li>
        <li>Forgiveness: Let go of grudges and seek reconciliation where needed (Matthew 6:14-15).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Refocus on the Goal (Philippians 3:12-14)</h3>
    <b>"Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on..."</b>

    <ul>
        <li>Apostle Paul reminds us that the Christian journey is a forward-moving race.</li>
        <li>Are we growing in
            prayer, Bible study, and service?</li>
        <li>Let us fix our eyes on the Lord Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Renew Your Commitment to God (Joshua 24:15)</h3>
    <b>"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."</b>

    <ul>
        <li>The start of a new year is an opportunity to renew our commitment to God and His purposes.</li>
        <li>Practical steps for renewal:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal devotion and prayer.</li>
            <li>Dedication to serve in the church and community.</li>
            <li>Sharing the Gospel with others.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Rest in God's Promises for the Future (Jeremiah 29:11)</h3>
    <b>"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord..."</b></ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Let's put our trust that God’s plans are for our good, even when the future seems uncertain.
        </li>
        <li>God’s promise of His presence: “I will never leave you nor forsake you” (Deuteronomy 31:6).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    As we finish this year, let us carry forward hearts filled with gratitude, faith that releases the past, focus on
    God’s purpose, and trust in His promises. Let us live for the glory of God.<br>

    <h3>Closing Scripture and Prayer</h3>
    <i>“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great
        is Your faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23)</i><br><br>

    <b>Let us Pray:</b>

    <pr><br><br><b>Our Loving Heavenly Father,</b><br>

        <br>We come before You with hearts full of gratitude for the year gone by. Thank You for the countless blessings, the lessons learned, and the strength You provided through every season. Even in challenges, You were our refuge and our help, and we praise You for Your unchanging faithfulness.<br><br>
        
        As we approach the end of this year, we ask for the strength to finish well. Empower us to fulfill our responsibilities with diligence, grace, and integrity. Renew our spirits to serve You wholeheartedly and to be a blessing to those around us.<br><br>
        
        Lord, as we prepare for a new year, we seek Your guidance and blessings. Lead us in the paths You have set before us. Illuminate our steps, and grant us the wisdom to make decisions that honor You. Pour out Your favor on our lives, families, and endeavors, and help us to walk in alignment with Your will.<br><br>
        
        May we step into the new year with faith, hope, and love, trusting fully in Your provision and promises.<br>
        
        <br>In the most precious name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, we pray,<br>
        <b><br>Amen.</b></pr>
