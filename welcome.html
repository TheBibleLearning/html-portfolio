    <h4 style="color:blueviolet">Why The Bible Learning?</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Bible is more than a historical book—it is the living Word of God, providing
        guidance, wisdom, and truth for
        every aspect of life. Through our platform, we aim to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Proclaim Jesus Christ as the Only Savior:</b> “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other
            name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” <b>(Acts 4:12).</b></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Showcase Jesus as the Way, the Truth, and the Life:</b>
            Jesus Himself declared, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through
            me” <b>(John 14:6).</b></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Encourage Personal Relationship with Jesus:</b>
            Knowing Jesus personally transforms lives. “Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his
            name, he gave the right to become children of God” <b>(John 1:12).</b></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Offer the Hope of Eternal Life:</b>
            Jesus promises, “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my
            hand” <b>(John 10:28).</b></li>
    </ul>
